# muream-maya-toolkit
A collection of all my personal tools, scripts and settings.

This is really tailored towards my personal workflow and launching maya with this installed will automatically change some settings and hotkeys.

Feel free to use or take anything from it.

# Installation
1. Download the repository anywhere.
2. Copy "MureamMayaToolkit.mod" to a directory that's in your MAYA_MODULE_PATH. On windows something like `Documents/maya/modules/` works just fine.
3. Edit that module file and change the path to the root folder of the repository.
