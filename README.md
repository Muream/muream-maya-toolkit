# muream-maya-tools
A collection of all my personal tools, scripts and settings.

This is really tailored towards my personal workflow and launching maya with this installed will automatically change some settings and hotkeys.

Feel free to use or take anything from it.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository like so: `git clone --recurse-submodules git://github.com/Muream/muream-maya-tools.git`
2. Add the `modules` folder to your `MAYA_MODULE_PATH`. A good way to do that is to add it in your Maya.env file like so:
```
MAYA_MODULE_PATH = path/to/muream-maya-tools/modules
```
